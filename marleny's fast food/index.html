    Beginning as a small area in the San Ignacio Marketplace, Ms. Marleny Espinoza soon expanded her business venture into something much bigger. Though she chose to remain as a small foodstall in downtown San Ignacio, the influence of her amazing cooking soon spread like wildfire in 2013; giving her the fame she deserves today!</p>
